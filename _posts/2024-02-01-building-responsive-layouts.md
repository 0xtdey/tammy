# Building Responsive Layouts with Modern CSS

Creating responsive layouts has become much easier with modern CSS features. In this post, I'll walk you through some powerful techniques using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## The Foundation: Mobile-First Approach

Always start with mobile design and progressively enhance for larger screens:

```css
/* Mobile styles first */
.container {
  padding: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}

/* Desktop and up */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    padding: 3rem;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid for Complex Layouts

CSS Grid excels at creating complex, two-dimensional layouts:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

This creates a responsive grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available space.

## Flexbox for Component Layouts

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts and component-level design:

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.nav-menu {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  list-style: none;
}
```

## Modern CSS Custom Properties

Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #dc2626;
  --spacing-sm: 1rem;
  --spacing-lg: 2rem;
}

.button {
  background: var(--color-primary);
  padding: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-lg);
}
```

## Container Queries (The Future)

Container queries allow components to respond to their container size rather than viewport size:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start mobile-first** and progressively enhance
2. **Use CSS Grid** for layout-level design
3. **Use Flexbox** for component-level design
4. **Leverage custom properties** for maintainable code
5. **Think in components** rather than pages

Building responsive layouts is an art that combines technical knowledge with design sensibility. The key is to understand your tools and when to use each one.
