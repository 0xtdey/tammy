# Building a Minimalist Portfolio with Jekyll: From Markdown to Modern Web

Ever wondered how modern, fast-loading websites are built without complex databases or server-side complications? Let me walk you through how this very website came to life using **Jekyll** - a simple yet powerful static site generator that transforms plain markdown files into beautiful, responsive websites.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a **static site generator** written in Ruby that takes your content written in markdown, applies layouts and styling, and generates a complete website made of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Think of it as a smart compiler that understands web development patterns.

### Why Choose Jekyll?

- **üöÄ Lightning Fast**: Static files load incredibly quickly
- **üìù Markdown-Powered**: Write content in simple, readable markdown
- **üé® Highly Customizable**: Full control over design and functionality
- **üí∞ Free Hosting**: Works perfectly with GitHub Pages
- **üîí Secure**: No databases or server-side code to hack
- **üì± Responsive**: Mobile-friendly out of the box

## The Architecture Behind This Site

### 1. **Content Management**

Instead of a complex CMS, this site uses a simple file-based approach:

```
_posts/              # Blog posts in markdown
_portfolio/          # Portfolio items in markdown
pages/              # Static pages (About, etc.)
assets/             # CSS, JavaScript, images
_layouts/           # HTML templates
_config.yml         # Site configuration
```

Every blog post is just a markdown file with some metadata at the top (called "front matter"). Here's what a typical post looks like:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My Awesome Post"
date: 2025-01-15
categories: [tutorial, web-dev]
---

# Your content starts here

Regular markdown content goes here...
```

### 2. **Design Philosophy**

The design follows a **minimalist approach** inspired by sites like [lelouch.dev](https://lelouch.dev/):

- **Clean Typography**: Instrument Serif for headings, JetBrains Mono for content
- **Simple Color Palette**: Red, white, and black for clarity
- **Responsive Layout**: Works beautifully on all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle-able theme for user preference

### 3. **Technology Stack**

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator
- **Markdown**: Content writing format
- **SCSS/CSS**: Styling and theming
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features (dark mode toggle)
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting and deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment pipeline

## How It All Works Together

### The Magic of Jekyll

When you run Jekyll, here's what happens:

1. **Reads Configuration**: Jekyll loads `_config.yml` for site settings
2. **Processes Content**: Converts markdown files to HTML
3. **Applies Layouts**: Wraps content in HTML templates
4. **Compiles Assets**: Processes CSS and JavaScript
5. **Generates Site**: Creates a complete static website in `_site/`

### Content Creation Flow

Adding new content is incredibly simple:

1. **Create a markdown file** in the appropriate folder
2. **Add front matter** with metadata
3. **Write your content** in markdown
4. **Commit and push** to GitHub
5. **GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys** your site

## Getting Started: Build Your Own

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with command line
- Git and GitHub account
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

**Install Ruby and Jekyll:**

```

**Create portfolio items:**

```bash
# Create portfolio collection
mkdir _portfolio
touch _portfolio/my-project.md
```

### Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages

2. **Push your code** to the repository
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Your site is live** at `https://yourusername.github.io`

## Advanced Features You Can Add

### Collections

Jekyll's collections feature allows you to group related content:

```yaml

    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
  </article>
{% endfor %}
```
