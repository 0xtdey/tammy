# Task Manager App

A comprehensive task management application built with the MERN stack, featuring real-time collaboration, user authentication, and an intuitive interface for managing projects and tasks.

## Project Overview

This project was born out of my need for a simple yet powerful task management tool that could handle both personal projects and team collaboration. The goal was to create something that's as easy to use as a todo list but as powerful as enterprise project management tools.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
- **Project Organization**: Group tasks into projects with different views
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Real-time Updates**: Live synchronization across all connected clients
- **Collaborative Workspaces**: Share projects with team members

### Advanced Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive task reordering and status changes
- **Due Dates & Reminders**: Never miss important deadlines
- **File Attachments**: Attach documents and images to tasks
- **Activity Timeline**: Track all changes and updates
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find tasks and projects

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React)

```javascript
// Component structure
├── components/
│   ├── TaskCard/
│   ├── ProjectBoard/
│   ├── UserAuth/
│   └── Navigation/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAuth.js
│   ├── useTasks.js
│   └── useWebSocket.js
└── context/
    ├── AuthContext.js
    └── TaskContext.js
```

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

```javascript
// API structure
├── routes/
│   ├── auth.js
│   ├── tasks.js
│   ├── projects.js
│   └── users.js
├── models/
│   ├── User.js
│   ├── Task.js
│   └── Project.js
└── middleware/
    ├── auth.js
    └── validation.js
```

### Database Design (MongoDB)

- **Users Collection**: User profiles and authentication data
- **Projects Collection**: Project metadata and member lists
- **Tasks Collection**: Task details with references to projects and users
- **Activities Collection**: Audit trail for all actions

## Key Implementation Details

### Real-time Updates with Socket.io

```javascript
// Client-side socket handling
useEffect(() => {
  socket.on("taskUpdated", (updatedTask) => {
    setTasks((prev) =>
      prev.map((task) => (task._id === updatedTask._id ? updatedTask : task))
    );
  });

  return () => socket.off("taskUpdated");
}, []);
```

### Authentication with JWT

```javascript
// Protected route middleware
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header("Authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "No token provided" });
  }

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
  }
};
```

### State Management with Context

```javascript
// Task context for global state
const TaskContext = createContext();

export const useTask = () => {
  const context = useContext(TaskContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useTask must be used within TaskProvider");
  }
  return context;
};
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Synchronization

**Problem**: Ensuring all clients stay synchronized without overwhelming the server.
**Solution**: Implemented room-based socket connections and optimistic updates with rollback on failure.

### Challenge 2: Complex State Management

**Problem**: Managing task states across multiple components and real-time updates.
**Solution**: Used React Context with useReducer for predictable state updates and custom hooks for data fetching.

### Challenge 3: Performance with Large Task Lists

**Problem**: App became slow with hundreds of tasks loaded at once.
**Solution**: Implemented virtual scrolling and pagination with lazy loading.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting with React.lazy()
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized MongoDB queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data

## Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: Joi schemas for all API endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for individual component and function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API endpoint testing
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for full user workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

## Deployment & DevOps

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify with automatic deployments from GitHub
- **Backend**: Deployed on Heroku with CI/CD pipeline
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for managed database hosting
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring

## Lessons Learned

1. **Real-time Features**: WebSockets add complexity but greatly improve UX
2. **State Management**: Proper state architecture is crucial for scalable apps
3. **User Feedback**: Beta testing revealed important UX improvements
4. **Performance**: Optimization should be considered from the beginning

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Mobile app with React Native
- [ ] Offline functionality with PWA features
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Integration with third-party tools (Slack, Google Calendar)
- [ ] AI-powered task suggestions and automation

The Task Manager App represents a significant milestone in my full-stack development journey, showcasing my ability to build complex, real-time applications with modern technologies.
