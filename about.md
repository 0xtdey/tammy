# About Me

<!-- {: .page-title} -->

Hey there — I’m Tammy, a Protocol Researcher who enjoys digging into the nuts and bolts of decentralized systems and asking, *“how can this be made both secure and scalable?”* My work sits at the crossroad of curiosity and pragmatism: I love exploring new protocol ideas, but I’m equally focused on turning them into reliable, production-ready systems that people can trust.  

What excites me most is bridging the gap between deep technical research and real-world adoption. Whether it’s evaluating a DeFi mechanism, stress-testing a new protocol upgrade, or crafting a clear technical story for investors, I thrive at translating complexity into clarity.

## What I Do

I currently work as a **Web3 Security Researcher at BLOK Capital**, where I:  
- Design and evaluate secure, scalable architectures for new protocol features.  
- Collaborate directly with founders on product direction and system design.  
- Review smart contract code and author documentation that engineers and non-technical stakeholders can both rely on.  
- Contribute to fundraising by translating highly technical concepts into narratives that resonate with investors.  

Before this, I worked independently as a **Web3 Security Researcher**, auditing more than ten codebases across leading contest platforms. Along the way, I’ve identified and reported vulnerabilities of varying severity, contributing to safer and more resilient ecosystems.

## Skills & Interests

I bring expertise in **protocol research**, **DeFi mechanism design**, and **security analysis**, supported by a solid grounding in cryptography and programming. My toolkit includes Solidity, Python, JavaScript, Foundry, and Hardhat.  

Outside of research, I enjoy writing — from technical deep-dives to academic publications — on blockchain security, smart contract risks, and the evolving challenges of decentralized systems.
